### Prepare the application configuration

1. In the Azure AI Foundry portal, view the **Overview** page for your project.
1. In the **Endpoints and keys** area, ensure that the **Azure AI Foundry** library is selected and view the **Azure AI Foundry project endpoint**. You'll use this endpoint to connect to your project and model in a client application.

    > **Note**: You can also use the Azure OpenAI endpoint!

1. Open a new browser tab (keeping the Azure AI Foundry portal open in the existing tab). Then in the new tab, browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`; signing in with your Azure credentials if prompted.

    Close any welcome notifications to see the Azure portal home page.

1. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment with no storage in your subscription.

    The cloud shell provides a command-line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal. You can resize or maximize this pane to make it easier to work in.

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, switch it to ***PowerShell***.

1. In the cloud shell toolbar, in the **Settings** menu, select **Go to Classic version** (this is required to use the code editor).

    **<font color="red">Ensure you've switched to the classic version of the cloud shell before continuing.</font>**

1. In the cloud shell pane, enter the following commands to clone the GitHub repo containing the code files for this exercise (type the command, or copy it to the clipboard and then right-click in the command line and paste as plain text):

    ```
   rm -r mslearn-ai-foundry -f
   git clone https://github.com/microsoftlearning/mslearn-ai-studio mslearn-ai-foundry
    ```

    > **Tip**: As you enter commands into the cloudshell, the output may take up a large amount of the screen buffer. You can clear the screen by entering the `cls` command to make it easier to focus on each task.

1. After the repo has been cloned, navigate to the folder containing the chat application code files and view them:

    ```
   cd mslearn-ai-foundry/labfiles/chat-app/python
   ls -a -l
    ```

    The folder contains a code file as well as a configuration file for application settings and a file defining the project runtime and package requrirements.

1. In the cloud shell command-line pane, enter the following command to install the libraries you'll use:

    ```
   python -m venv labenv
   ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt azure-identity azure-ai-projects openai
    ```
